# 🏠 Smart Tax – $25K Rental Passive Loss Deduction Qualifier

Did you know the IRS allows eligible rental property owners to deduct up to **$25,000 in passive losses** from their regular income?

This tool helps individuals determine if they qualify for this little-known yet powerful tax break — based on income, ownership, and participation levels.

## 💼 Who This Is For

- Rental property owners with **less than $150,000 AGI**
- Landlords who actively manage or materially participate
- W-2 earners looking to offset income with passive losses
- Anyone unsure if they meet the IRS activity requirements

---

## 🧮 What This App Checks

- **Adjusted Gross Income (AGI)** eligibility
- **Material participation** and time spent managing property
- **Ownership percentage** (must own at least 10%)
- Filing status and phase-out impact
- Real-time IRS-based recommendation

## 🔍 Why I Built This

Many of my clients are missing out on thousands in deductible losses because no one told them they might qualify — or how to calculate it.

This app helps them take 60 seconds to see if they’re sitting on a **five-figure tax credit**.
